# About
This is very simple web app, which randomises combination of 1-5 finger, with A-G note every x time elapsed.

# Why i made this
I'm currently trying to learn piano based on [Bill Hilton's](https://billspianopages.com/about-bill) lessons on YouTube, and I'm too lazy to think of random combinations myself, so that's why.
